# NGINX Config File
#
#   I want to keep this under version control instead of rogue on the server.
#   I'm using nginx's reverse-proxy feature to serve multiple nodejs sites
#    on a single server, it routes each domain to a different local port with
#    a nodejs app sitting on the other side.
#
#   Assuming the server is running Amazon Linux, just make sure that there's
#    a symlink to this file in the nginx config folder:
#
#       cd /etc/nginx/conf.d/
#       sudo ln -s /home/ubuntu/khan-draw/nginx.draw.oodavid.com.conf .
#
#   ...if this file is updated and pushed to the server the settings will not
#    take effect until nginx reloads the configs:
#
#       sudo nginx -s reload
server {

        listen 443;
        server_name draw.oodavid.com;
        root /home/ubuntu/khan-draw;
        index index.html index.htm;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /home/ubuntu/draw.oodavid.com.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /home/ubuntu/draw.oodavid.com.key;
}
